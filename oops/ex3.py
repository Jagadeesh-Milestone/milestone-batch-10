#python self:
#the class methods should have an extra first argument in the method defintion.
#we do not give any values to this argument when we call this method.
#if we have a method that takes no argumets ,still we have one argument that
#argument is called "self".

#if we call a method of object as myobject.method(x,y) it is automaically
#converted by python into myclass.method(myobject,x,y).

#it is not a python keyword.
