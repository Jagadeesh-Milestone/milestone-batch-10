#iterators:
#iterators are the python objects which we can iterate over them.
#generally we can iterate over sequences
#the objects which we can use for loop are the iterators

#int:
#x=10
#for i in x:
  #  print(i)

#bool
#y=True
#for i in y:
   # print(i)

l=[10,20,30,40]
for i in l:
    print(i*5)

b=(10,20,30,40)
for i in b:
    print(i)

d={'name':'hari','address':'bangalore'}
for i in d:
    print(i)

s={10,20,30,40}
for i in s:
    print(i)

x='bangalore'
for i in x:
    print(i)

#in the above examples l,b,d,s and x are the itarables
#the values in the itarable are called iterators
#the process we are doing here is called iteration
